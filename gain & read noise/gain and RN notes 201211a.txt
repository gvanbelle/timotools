For gain data:
	Set up MaxIm to record multiple flats, daytime sky, 340nm filter.
	Image time: 1.0,1.2,1.4,2.0,2.5,3.0 seconds, 3 frames each
	run $ collectGainData.sh
		which executes multiple lines of:
			$ ./gainEst2.py 'Autosave Image -000[1-3]flat30.fits' 34 >> gainData.txt
		and reports the average counts, and difference frame variance, of the central 34x34 pixels of the frame
			34 pixels was picked for the min error in the variance; presumably a flatter flat would allow this to be bigger
	Read gainData.txt into Excel, do two-err fit
	See Pereyra+ 2017, figure 7 (axes flipped)
	Gain is 2.095 ± 0.075 e-/ADU

For read-noise data:
	Set up MaxIm to record multiple biases, and short darks
	Image time: 0,1,2,5,10 sec, 5 frames each
	run $ collectRNData.sh
		which executes multiple lines of:
			$ ../readNoiseEst2.py '*bias.fits' > output.txt
		and reports 
	See Pereyra+ 2017, figure 8
	Read noise is 18.64 ± 0.670 e-
