Here is the telescopes.py file that needs to be put in the ./setup directory of the pipeline installation. I had to modify the raw images with the following to make this work:
-Remove blank spaces from file names

$ for f in *; do mv "$f" `echo $f | tr ' ' '_'`; done

-Remove dashes (-) from file names

$ for f in *; do mv "$f" `echo $f | tr '-' '_'`; done

-Replace .fts suffix with .fits

$ for f in *.fts; do mv -- "$f" "${f%.fts}.fits"; done

-Redefine INSTRUME header keyword
        $ sethead *fits INSTRUME=â€˜PWFLI'
